    Use the GloVe Model with embeddings of 300 dimensions and a vocabulary of
    6 billions words to create the embedding of documents using the average of
    the embeddings of the words in the document.

    Not better than Doc2Vec or BERT, but it fast and can be used to check the
    effectiveness of the models implemented.
